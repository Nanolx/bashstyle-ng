Overview of changes in v9.1 "Dial T for TNT"

=== Bug Fixes ===

* #187 (vim-rc):
	set softtabstop instead of shiftwidth for setting tab length
* #188 (keybindings-rc):
	some of the keybindings set from UI didn't take effect
* #189 (colorshell):
	option colorshell_reset did not work
* #190 (bashstyle.sh/nx-rc):
	improve start-up mechanism, so that PS1 definied in ${HOME}/.bashrc
	does not override PS1 set by BashStyle-NG

=== Widgets ===

* added CellRendererClickablePixbuf from Tryton (http://www.tryton.org/),
  with minor updates to be GTK+3 compatible

=== User Interface ===

* majorly revised the Custom Prompt Builder (both UI and Code):
 - unified functions in python code where possible
 - removed "Place in (...)" buttons
 - only one "Empty", "Undo" and "Redo" button each for both TextViews
   (it is now auto-detected which one of both is the currently active one)
 - use monospaced font in the input fields
 - add scrollbars to the Custom Prompt Builder (prevents window from getting
   immensively huge when inserting large prompts like Equinox)
 - add "Reset" button: reset to last saved user configuration
 - add "Factory" button: reset to vendor or factory configuration
 - when inserting functions or variables into PROMPT_COMMAND or PS1 the output
   will be modified so that it conforms with where it's been added, example:
   - ${eusercolor} for PROMPT_COMMAND and ${usercolor} for ${PS1} or
   - $(systemkit usedram%) for PROMPT_COMMAND and \$(systemkit usedram%) for PS1

* restructure prompt color settings
 ++ before: two combined combo boxes (not optimal from usability view)
 ++ after : a separate combo box for each color setting

* re-arrange some settings in 'Advanced' category. Rename 'Extra' sub-section
  into 'BashStyle-NG', 'Misc' sub-section into 'Bash Builtin'.

* remove AboutDialog-Window and make it a custom tab page instead

* re-align widget groups for the better looks
* show what category the user is currently in, in the header
* added missing revert-to-default icons for PWD Length Spinbutton
* show icon on the "Back", "Empty", "Undo" and "Redo" buttons again
* major restructuring and updating of widgets in all categories
* minor string changes

=== General ===

* add trap_add function. It allows adding multiple commands to a trap one after
  another by grabbing the previous trapped functions and re-building the trap
  (by Richard Hansen https://stackoverflow.com/a/7287873)

* record executed command and it's exist status. This will be available using
  ${lastcommand} (full length),  ${lastcommandprintable} (truncated to max. 25
  characters or filled with spaces to reach 25 characters, for prompts) and
  ${lastexit} variables. This is not recorded for:
  - completion
  - trap
  - PROMPT_COMMAND

  for not overriding the useful info with useless, as well as for:

  - echo ${lastcommand}
  - echo ${lastcommandprintable}
  - echo ${lastexit}

  so users are able to grab the values in all cases. Add all three to the
  Custom Prompt Builder.

* rename lscd_mkdir config into customcd_mkdir and make it apply for both lscd
  and treecd
* add treecd_opts config (similar to lscd_opts)
* improve treecd (make it internally work like lscd)
* make colorshell a trap rather than embedding it in PROMPT_COMMAND
* remove PRE_PROMPT_COMMAND

=== Styles ===

* Renamed "Clock Advanced" Prompt to "Equinox" (the name change is handled
  internally, the config updated automatically, no user interaction required)
* re-bind RETURN to C-l\C-j when Equinox is the active style. The Style is now
  properly re-drawn after command execution (no more overlapping "arms")
* include ${lastexit} and ${lastcommand} as follows in Equinox:
	( ✔: some command )─┤	-- for a successfully executed command
	( ✘: some command )─┤	-- for a non-successfully executed command
* simplify Equinox code a little bit
* don't draw arms in Equinox if the terminal height is less than 16 lines

=== Bash Settings ===

* add GLOBIGNORE: everything to ignore from globbing. Default value: empty.
 ++ if you set it to ".:.." issuing '$ ls .*' will not include '.' and '..'

* add History Sync: sync history between simultaneously running sessions.
 ++ commands from other sessions become available to 'history' immediately,
 ++ to bash after reloading prompt ([ENTER])

* add dotglob:		include hidden files (with leading dot) by default during
			pathname expansion
* add extglob:		enable extending globbing with regular expression like
			extensions (see: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/glob#extglob)
* add nocaseglob:	ignore case during globbing
* add nocasematch:	case insensitive matching for 'case' and '[[' commands

=== Keybindings ===

* add 'Revert' column: revert setting to last saved user value
* add 'Default' column: revert setting to vendor or factory default
* removed 'Reset Keybindings' button (no longer needed with clickable Pixbuf)
* add 'None' column: allow keybindings without modificator (only useful for
  keys like TAB for example to bind menu-complete to it)

* removed Advanced > Tab Rotation, added menu-complete to Keybindings instead.
 - if you want to re-enable this feature set menu-complete in Keybindings to TAB
   with no modificator checked

* new standard keybindings:
++ menu-complete-backward (default: Ctrl-Tab)
++ backward-kill-line (default: Alt-k)

* new custom keybindings:
++ rerun-root (rerun last command as root, default: Alt-r)
++ list-keys (list all bound command and their keybindings, default: Alt-p)

* made TreeViewColumn headers translatable

=== Readline ===

* New Readline options:
 - colored-stats:	if visible-stats is true, color them using LS_COLORS
 - skip-completed-text:	when completing, don't duplicate text after cursor.
			example: if you have type: '$ sh' and then do completion
			'$ /bin/b[TAB]sh' it will end up '$ /bin/bash' when this
			setting is On, '$ /bin/bashsh' when this setting is Off

=== Vim ===

* New color schemes provided:
 - Molokai
 - Vivi Chalk
 - Meta 5
 - Woju
 - Lightning
 - Paper Color
 - Solarized

* New Vim options:
 - expandtabs:	   convert a [TAB] into [SPACE]s
 - wildmenu:	   show possible command completions above vim command line and
		   cycle through using [TAB], very similar to Bash/Readline
 - foldenable:	   enable folding of large code blocks
 - foldlevelstart: at what level of code to start folding (0 for immediate
		   folding, 99 for no folding)
 - foldestmax:	   maximum level of nested foldings
 - foldmethod:	   method to determine when to fold either indet (default),
		   marker, manual, expression, syntax or diff

=== Nano ===

* New Nano options:
 - enable_mouse:   enable full mouse support (copy, select ...)
 - no_wrap:	   disable wrapping of long lines
 - log_position:   remember position in file when exiting and restore when
		   opening the file again
 - tab_size:	   column-width of [TAB]s
 - tab_to_spaces:  convert a [TAB]  into [SPACE]s
 - set_uicolors:   master option to enable the following options
	- function_color_fg:	text color for function descriptions
	- function_color_bg:	background color for function descriptions
	- key_color_fg:		text color for key bindings in help
	- key_color_bg:		background color for key bindings in help

 - symbolic links
 - sockets
 - pipes
 - block devices
 - character devices

Overview of changes in v9.0 "A New Wave"

=== NOTES ===

* The first-run-wizard (bsng-wizard) has been removed, relevant options have been
  merged into the main application, be sure to run the UI (Style for colorshell,
  else Advanced and GIT) after upgrade to re-adjust your settings that got lost
  by this change (if any).

* This release removes the html-documentation. Instead every options will have a
  tooltip showing the name of the configuration variable (or -- if none) and the
  description of the setting [work in progress].

* Configure now looks for python3 by default, falls back to python2 or python.

=== Bug Fixes ===

* #154 (ui):
	icons for reverting to user-default or factory-default settings were
	missing from some GtkEntry and all GtkSpinButton.
* #155 (configure):
	when using --python configure flag that given python interpreter
	was not used to check if required modules are available
* #156 (text2morse):
	python3 support in text2morse
* #157 (readline):
	when changing settings for readline they didn't take effect immediately
* #158 (lockfile):
	the lockfile module required additional fixes to fully work with both python2
	and python3
* #159 (pkgconfig):
	install pkgconfig file into ${PREFIX}/share/pkgconfig, not ${PREFIX}/lib/pkgconfig/
* #160 (nx-rc):
	fixed history settings from ui were not always applied on the shell
* #161 (colorshell):
	random selection of colors in colorshell hasn't really been random
* #162 (config):
	if a vendor configuration (/etc/bs-ng_vendor.ini) exists, let the revert
	configuration icon on GtkEntry and GtkSpinButton revert to vendor
	configuration instead of factory configuration
* #163 (colorshell):
	fix colorshell not being available to all prompt styles
* #164 (styles):
	fix PRE_PROMPT_COMMAND not available to monochrome versions of ayoli,
	clock, clock-ad and poweruser prompt styles [if you create a function
	of that name in ${HOME}/.bashstyle.custom you can hook into those
	style's PROMPT_COMMAND (the other styles don't have PROMPT_COMMAND,
	so you can freely create one for them)]
* #165 (colors):
	fixed pscolor not being set
* #166 (styles):
	fixed that most styles called trunc_pwd instead of truncpwd
* #167 (truncpwd):
	change the way truncpwd obtains it's settings, so that it always
	works as expected (and only loads them once)
* #168 (custom prompt builder):
	fixed custom prompt builder not properly inserting default styles
	into the textbuffers for further customization
* #169 (truncpwd):
	when maximum length of pwd is 0 don't truncate it all.
* #170 (config):
	when configuration file exists, but is broken, restore either vendor
	or factory default configuration for the user
* #171 (wrappers):
	if you felt brave enough to enable dirinfo wrappers, they still didn't
        work properly, because of a change in the setup mechanism that wasn't
	reflected in the wrappers
* #172 (clock-ad) (truncpwd):
	when changing to a user not having BashStyle-NG set-up prompts were
	incorrect, as some required settings for truncpwd, respectively
	clock-ad's internal pwd-truncating function, were not set
* #173 (nx-rc):
	on Debian GNU/Linux ensure that ~/.bashrc does not override BashStyle-NG's
	PS1, by commenting-out the corresponding parts of the file
* #174 (assign):
	fix assign function by making it an actual function, not a script
* #175 (check_opt):
	make check_opt a script, so that other script can properly call it
* #176 (ruler):
	new version of ruler function, working again
* #177 (grep):
        make new grep "GREP_OPTIONS is deprecated" warning shut up
* #178 (show_mem):
        use top instead of free (more precision, also avoids errors between
	different free output format variants)
* #179 (configobj):
	enforce configobj encoding to be utf8 to ensure everything works fine
* #180 (nanorc):
	enabling syntax highlighting for GNU Nano did not work properly
* #181 (git):
	allow git configuration to apply, if Bash configuration is not used
* #182 (birthday greetings):
	fixup user birthday greeting message
* #183 (readline):
	make Readline configuration properly apply, if Bash configuration is
	not used (previously it would be created in the first new Bash session,
	but not applied, so it (or changes to it) took until the second new
	Bash session after program run to make readline configuration apply)
* #184 (make):
	fix desktop file not being installed
* #185 (configure):
	properly check for python version (was confused by version longer than
	four digits, for example 2.7.10 which translated to 2710)
* #186 (configure):
	properly exit configure if a dependency was not met in all cases
	(for example did not exit when the found python interpreter's
	version did exceed the maximum version or was below the minimum)

=== Wizard-Merge ===

  - This allows you to change 29 default bash/readline keybindings.
    (2 of them are not used by default).
  - Additionally theres a 30th, custom, keybinding: complete-path.
    If you press the assigned key while the cursor is at the end of a

* reload function: a clean function to reload .bashrc (x2cd)
* quickscript function: writes all commands in history to a file.
  starting point is the last occurrence of "###" (joedhon)

  ngroups lists all user-groups you're NOT in. (gniourf_gniourf)
* psgrep function: find process by name (flatcap)
* map function: takes a command with any number of arguments and applies
  it to each item in a list. It's basically a shorthand way of writing a
  for loop. (downdiagonal)

Overview of changes in v8.4 "Mind The Gap"

=== NOTES ===

* BashStyle-NG uses ConfigObj for storing configuration. Since
  version 5.0.0 ConfigObj supports Python 3.2 and 3.3. If your
  distribution ships an older version of ConfigObj, use the
  --python=/path/to/python2 configure flag to ensure python2 is
  being used.

=== Bug fixes ===

* #148 (alias):
	fix aliases #8 and #9 set from UI weren't setup on Bash
* #149 (count_files):
	-f/+f and -d/+d params were exchanged

* #153 (python3):
	full python3 support (ConfigObj only supports 3.2 and 3.3 officially)

=== New Features ===

* direxpand: Bash >= 4.3 features a new shopt: direxpand. Enabling this
             causes Bash to expand directory names in completion like
             Bash 4.1 did.
* globasciiranges: Bash >= 4.3 features a new shop: globasciirange.
                   Enabling this causes Bash to use character ordering
                   like in the C locale when globbing ranges.
* show-mode-in-prompt: New readline option to show the current editing
                       mode in the prompt

=== Misc. Changes ===

* minor UI improvement (tabs on the left, smaller icons on tabs,
  text below icons on tab)
* add "Report Bugs" button to the about dialog
* updated and completed german translation

* configure 4.2.3: add --bashrc option to pass a specific system
                   wide bashrc (required for bashstyle-ng init)

* bump supported python versions to 3.3 (only if you have ConfigObj 5)

Overview of changes in v8.00 "We're Getting High With The Rhythm"

--- Important Note #1 ---

This release switched from GConf based configuration to ConfigObj.

Advantages:
	- *much* faster startup from terminal
	- usable from both python (ConfigObj) and Bash (ini-parser)
	  [read: all options could be changed from Bash now, too]
	- bs-ng-profiler and rc-generator no longer required

Disadvantages:
	- you have to fully re-setup BashStyle-NG (both GUI and Wizard)

--- Important Note #2 ---

This release requires GTK+3 / Python-GI

=== Bug fixes ===
* #128 (ui):
	fixed C-P-B (Custom Prompt Builder) showing no longer existent
	themes (and theme-code) from the "Choose Style to modify:" combo-box
* #129 (configure):
	when configured via debian/rules, configure got the prefix wrong
* #130 (profile):
	display-managers like XDM don't source /etc/profile.d/*,
	so let nx-rc self-check, whether our profile was sourced
* #131 (readline/vim/nano):
	don't create an rc for readline, vim or nano, if one is already going
	to be created (fixes annoying issues when opening splitvt or two
	terminals at a time)
* #132 (show_system_load):
	enforce LANG=C when calling uptime, so that it properly works in all cases
* #133 (toolbox/about):
	fix the bug that the toolbox and about-dialog could only
	be properly invoked once per session
* #134 (configure):
	fix detection of gir-repository-path on x86_64 (tested on Fedora 18)
* #135 (functions):
	define all functions as such, to prevent errors on startup if a vendor
	alias has the same name then a BS-NG function (eg: ll on Fedora)
* #136 (make):
	fixed uninstallation of BS-NG
* #137 (debian/control):
	make debian package depend on gir1.2-gtk-3.0

=== Added Features ===
* configure can now check for GIR Repositories
* configure can now check for python sub-modules
* options like aliases can now be reverted to previous user-value
  or reset to factory defaults in the user interface
* -n param for 'randomfile' (exec randomfile N times)
* 'jump' feature (jump between directories, uses dirinfo database)
* 'assign' function
* 'bsng-help' function (auto-generates help messages)

=== Removed Features ===
* bs-ng-profiler (no longer required)

Overview of changes in v7.12.1 "Do You Like The Sound Now?"

=== Bug Fixes ===
* #125 (ui): change the way the GUI retrieves it's own version and
             prefix, fixes possible startup-failures on foreign setups
* #126 (dirinfo-wrappers): even if the dirinfo-wrappers were disabled,
                           they could interfere with the original rm,
			   mv, cp and shred tools. If you updated from
			   version 7.12, please restart your machine
			   after you installed 7.12.1, to ensure every-
			   thing is fine with your setup
* #127 (uninstall): manual uninstall didn't remove GConf Schemas

=== Build & Installation ===
* show version of configure in --help
* add --quiet switch to configure
* fix configure --help message

* show version of make in --help
* improve look'n'feel of make out-put (more like configure now)
* fixed a typo in a make warning

=== Added Features ===
* batch [TJ Carter]

=== Misc Changes ====
* shut up bs-ng-wizard (when already setup and bs-ng loads)
* updated my mail-address
* updated debian/ scripts to 3.0 (quilt)

Overview of changes in v7.12 "Planetary Collapse"

--- IMPORTANT NOTE #1 ---
We do now have a custom make system. See INSTALL.

--- IMPORTANT NOTE #2 ---
If you have custom settings stored in $HOME/.custom-rc, then rename the file
to $HOME/.bashstyle.custom, else they won't be loaded anymore.

--- (NOT SO) IMPORTANT NOTE #3 ---
This version of BS-NG can install wrapper for cp, mv, shred and rm, which
honour the NoCopy, NoMove, NoShred and NoDelete .dirinfo-flags (see below).

Those are only 90% syntax-compatible with the originals (say: `mv test{1,2}'
works, but `mv test{1,2} test{3,4}' does NOT -- only one {,} is supported),
maybe there are more incompatibilities. This will be fixed with Revision 3.

Therefore those wrappers are disabled by default, if you feel brave enough
to try them out pass `--dirinfo-enable' to the configure script.


=== Bugfixes ===
* #105 (unmark): properly unalias the bookmark
* #106 (bookmark): don't create a bookmark when no name is given
* #107 (about): fixed link to homepage of BS-NG
* #108 (profiler) (rcgenerator): load internal functions correctly
* #109 (ls-rc): make ls-rc linux-console compatible
* #110 (random-rc): remove no longer existenet styles from random-style-selector
* #111 (color-rc) (ls-rc): don't disable colors when on linux-console, but only
                           use default colors, which are black, red, yellow, green,
                           blue, cyan, magenta and white. Others are synonyms of them
                           while on linux-console (eg: iceblue = blue)
* #112 (man-rc) (ls-rc) (alias-rc) (options-rc): properly enable/disable colors according
                                                 to user-setting (ls, lscd, grep, man)
* #113 (vim-rc): fix setting highlighting
* #114 (readline-rc) (nano-rc) (vim-rc): check wether rc-file is accessible before writing it
* #115 (configure): change the way python modules are detected (fixes rpmbuild failure)
* #116 (ayoli) (clock-ad): the first line of the prompt in ayoli was longer than the screen
* #117 (check_opt): check_opt should error rather than exiting the session (...)
* #118 (autotools): there's a bug in the autotools which may not let you compile any source
                    if /bin/sh is not /bin/bash (...) workaround this by exporting
                    CONFIG_SHELL="/bin/bash" in /etc/profile.d/bashstyle.sh (...)
* #119 (nx-rc): when you started several shells at once ReadlineCFG, VimCFG and NanoCFG could
                have generated invalid configuration files (all instances of them adding the
		values), this is now prevented by starting BS-NG one by one
* #120 (clock-ad) (ayoli): fixed truncated the current directory
* #121 (nx-rc) (bs-ng-wizard): could have possibly hung up if bs-ng-wizard was loaded when no
			       config was not yet created
* #122 (bs-ng.py): don't wrongly require vte
* #123 (make): fixed installation outside of /usr as non-root user by not
               forcing the icons to be installed into /usr
* #124 (nx-rc): properly close the if-statement, which detects GDM

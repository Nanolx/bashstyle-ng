@heading 9.3 ``Trick or Treat''
@itemize @bullet

@item Bug Fixes
@itemize @minus
@item #204 (debian vendor config): fixed error in Debian vendor configuration,
preventing BashStyle-NG UI from startup.

@item #205 (ui): fixed buttons for saving, restoring, deleting and reverting
user configuration in UI not working.

@item #206 (manpage colors): enforce environment variable @code{PAGER} to be
@code{less}, else colorizing manpages might fail, if an  other pager is used.

@item #207 (trap): fix recording exit code of last command if it fails.

@item #208 (startup): fix enabling @code{BashStyle-NG} in @code{$HOME/.bashrc}
from user interface in certain cases.

@item #209 (startup): add file check when enabling @code{BashStyle-NG} in
@code{$HOME/.bashrc}, so that @code{Bash} does not run into errors on startup
when @code{BashStyle-NG} was uninstalled, but the startup entry still exists.
Aswell as when it was installed to a different prefix, without having adjusted
the startup entry in @code{$HOME/.bashrc} (or re-enabled @code{BashStyle-NG}
from the user interface (which would update the startup entry).

@item #210 (configuration): when @code{ini_version} of @code{$HOME/.bs-ng.ini} is
bigger than @code{app_ini_version}, the configuration is reset to either vendor or
factory default configuration. When doing so the configuration was not reloaded
by the user interface (which could potentially lead to a crash).

@item #211 (colorshell): new option @code{Dark Terminal Background} allows user
to set whether the terminal background is dark or bright. This option is used for
colorshell to prevent the font color being black on dark terminals, respectively
white/grey on bright terminals in order to avoid barely readable text output.

This option also applies to all other terminal dependant color settings in
@code{BashStyle-NG}, where @code{white} will be @code{black} on bright terminals,
respectively @code{black} will be @code{white} on dark terminals.

@item #212 (readline): fixed setting @code{bell-style} readline variable.

@item #213 (readline): fixed setting @code{completion-ignore-case} readline variable.

@item #214 (ls colors): fixed readline not inheriting @code{LS_COLORS} set by
@code{BashStyle-NG}. This resulted in readline functions using distribution default
@code{LS_COLORS}, but bash functions using the user set variable.

@item #215 (lastcommand): fixed lastcommand recording to generate ugly results for
bash prompts (@code{lastcommandprintable}) by removing all newlines from the string.
@end itemize

@item New Features
@itemize @minus
@item New Termcap/Manpage coloring function. @code{BashStyle-NG} now allows you
to choose the different colors for manpages from the User Interface, rather than
only giving you a handful of pre-defined color schemes.

@item New Bash 4.4 features support:
@itemize +
@item @code{EXECIGNORE} a colon-separated list of commands to ignore from completion.
Only matched if the *complete* filename matches. For example if you want to exclude

	@code{/usr/bin/autoreconf}

from command completion, you need to add

	@code{*/autreconf}

to @code{EXECIGNORE}.

@item @code{PS0} prompt and color setting. A new prompt which is displayed after
completion was done and before the completed command is executed.
@end itemize

@item New Readline 7.0 features support:
@itemize +
@item added Readline 7.0 master switch (enable to make use of the following).

@item @code{Colored Completion Prefix} makes the matching prefix of the issued
completion appear in a special color for all matches.

@item @code{Enable Bracketed Paste} makes Bash handle multi-line pasted code
like single-line, preventing erroneous completion or execution.

@item @code{Vi Command Mode String} is an indicator printed after @code{PS1} when
Bash is in vi command mode.

@item @code{Vi Insert Mode String} is an indicator printed after @code{PS1} when
Bash is in vi insert mode.

@item @code{Emacs Mode String} is an indicator printed after @code{PS1} when Bash
is in emacs mode.
@end itemize
@end itemize

@item Updated / Improved Features
@itemize @minus
@item @code{random} function's @code{--numericalrange}, @code{-r} param previously
only allowed setting the @code{highest} value of random range, starting from zero.
Now it's possible to set the @code{lowest} value optionally, aswell. Both syntaxes
are supported:

@code{random -r 10} will give you a random number between 0 and 10
@code{random -r 5 10} will give you a random number between 5 and 10

@item @code{colors} added support for both @code{grey} and @code{white} in all
color settings. Note: depending on your terminal's color settings you might not
see a difference here, that's not a bug.
@end itemize

@item UI changes
@itemize @minus
@item Use @code{GtkSwitch}es instead of @code{GtkRadionButton}s for main
switches in the UI.

@item Make the radio buttons @code{use lscd instead of cd} and
@code{use treecd instead of cd} exclude each other.
@end itemize

@item Configure
@itemize @minus

@item 4.3.8
@itemize +

@item make build dependencies a separate dependency group.
@end itemize
@end itemize

@item Misc. Changes
@itemize @minus
@item Improvements to @code{bashstyle} launcher script.

@item Standardize shebangs in python scripts (and remove
corresponding lintian override).

@heading 9.2 ``Galvanize''
@itemize @bullet

@item Bug Fixes
@itemize @minus
@item #191 (make): gtk-update-icon-cache was not properly invoked after make
install

@item #192 (custom prompt builder): inserting prompt parts from GtkComboBoxes
did not work

@item #193 (nano): setting Nano UI Colors an Tabs to Spaces did not work

@item #194 (colors): color definitions have not been properly exported to
external scripts, which thus always displayed monochrome output

@item #195 (nx-rc): fixed filtering out @code{trap} from @code{lastcommand}
storing [Mingye Wang]

@item #196 (nx-rc): fixup @code{lastexit} value storing [Mingye Wang]

@item #197 (nano) (vim) (readline) (keybindings): fixup file existence checks
which are intended to prevent file conflicts when multiple Bash sessions are
started at the same time [Mingye Wang]

@item #198 (nx-rc): fixup detection of vendor ini version on first load of nx-rc
if no user ini exists

@item #199 (reload): fixup reload to properly restore the complete environment,
including BashStyle-NG and Bash Programmable Completion.

@item #200 (dd_opts): ensure setting DD_OPTS is properly done.

@item #201 (ls_colors): setting Tar/XZ color from UI didn't work.

@item #202 (configure): fixed last arguement passed to configure not being honoured.
@end itemize

@item Configuration File Changes
@itemize @minus
@item Additionally to factory and vendor (/etc/bs-ng_vendor.ini) configuration
BashStyle-NG now also checks for user backup ($HOME/.bs-ng.ini.save)
configuration when resetting configuration

@item Before using user backup or vendor configuration in any way do a dry-load
to ensure the files are in proper shape, if they contain errors skip them

@item When the configuration file can't be loaded due errors, let BashStyle-NG
auto-reset the configuration using user backup (if it exists) > vendor
configuration (if it exists) > factory configuration (in that order). This
prevents BashStyle-NG from crashing if there's something wrong with the
user configuration file

@item Added new Category "Configuration" which allows to:
@itemize +

@item Backup
@item Restore (from user backup configuration)
@item delete Backup configuration
@item Reset (reset from vendor or factory configuration) the configuration
@item Edit various configuration files (uses xdg-open to open files), namely:
@itemize x

@item .bashrc
@item .bashstyle.custom (bashrc-extension always loaded after BashStyle-NG,
thus can use BashStyle-NG variables and functions reliably)
@item .vimrc.custom (vimrc extension that is not managed by BashStyle-NG)
@item .inputrc.custom (inputrc extension that is not managed by BashStyle-NG)
@end itemize
@end itemize

also shows version of user, user backup, vendor and factory configuration files
(None for vendor and user backup if they don't exist)

@item icon name for this category in UI: bs-ng-config

@item after configuration is restored or reset the application is restarted
@end itemize

@item StartUp Mechanism Changes
@itemize @minus
@item Before BashStyle-NG embedded into /etc/bash.bashrc or /etc/bashrc to add
a startup entry to $HOME/.bashrc. Now if $HOME/.bashrc does not contain a
startup entry for BashStyle-NG the user is presented a tab page upon UI start
asking whether to add the entry. Also works when the startup entry for
BashStyle-NG is commented out, or if the entry is from a previous installation
of BashStyle-NG that had a different installation prefix.
@end itemize

@item Prompt Part Changes
@itemize @minus

@item PS2 / PS3 / PS4 changes: Before there's been an option for PS234. Setting
this to ">" resulted in

@itemize +
@item PS2=">"
@item PS3=">>"
@item PS4=">>>"
@end itemize

Now there's an separate option for each (including a color option each)

@item additionally PS2 / PS3 / PS4 export does now honor enable_colors setting
@end itemize

@item History Syncro Changes
@itemize @minus

@item BashStyle-NG 9.1 introduced a custom history sync functionality (for
syncing history over simultaneously running sessions), which turned out to break
Bash $HISTCONTROL, as it modified the history from outside. This is now worked
around by custom functions replacing the $HISTCONROL of Bash since it fails
due to the custom history handling functions. Please note that this might slow
down Bash a bit if you have a huge history.
@end itemize

@item New Functions

@item xmltagdelete: delete tags from xml files, see @code{xmltagdelete --help}

@item 2048.bash: 2048 game in Bash, see @code{2048.bash --help}

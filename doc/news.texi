@heading 9.2.0 ``Galvanize''
@itemize @bullet

@item Bug Fixes
@itemize @minus
@item #191 (make): gtk-update-icon-cache was not properly invoked after make
install

@item #192 (custom prompt builder): inserting prompt parts from GtkComboBoxes
did not work

@item #193 (nano): setting Nano UI Colors an Tabs to Spaces did not work

@item #194 (colors): color definitions have not been properly exported to
external scripts, which thus always displayed monochrome output
@end itemize

@item Configuration File Changes
@itemize @minus
@item Additionally to factory and vendor (/etc/bs-ng_vendor.ini) configuration
BashStyle-NG now also checks for user backup ($HOME/.bs-ng.ini.save)
configuration when resetting configuration

@item Before using user backup or vendor configuration in any way do a dry-load
to ensure the files are in proper shape, if they contain errors skip them

@item When the configuration file can't be loaded due errors, let BashStyle-NG
auto-reset the configuration using user backup (if it exists) > vendor
configuration (if it exists) > factory configuration (in that order). This
prevents BashStyle-NG from crashing if there's something wrong with the
user configuration file

@item Added new Category "Configuration" which allows to:
@itemize +

@item Backup
@item Restore (from user backup configuration)
@item delete Backup configuration
@item Reset (reset from vendor or factory configuration) the configuration
@item Edit various configuration files (uses xdg-open to open files), namely:
@itemize x

@item .bashrc
@item .bashstyle.custom (bashrc-extension always loaded after BashStyle-NG,
thus can use BashStyle-NG variables and functions reliably)
@item .vimrc.custom (vimrc extension that is not managed by BashStyle-NG)
@item .inputrc.custom (inputrc extension that is not managed by BashStyle-NG)
@end itemize
@end itemize

also shows version of user, user backup, vendor and factory configuration files
(None for vendor and user backup if they don't exist)

@item icon name for this category in UI: bs-ng-config

@item after configuration is restored or reset the application is restarted
@end itemize

@item StartUp Mechanism Changes
@itemize @minus
@item Before BashStyle-NG embedded into /etc/bash.bashrc or /etc/bashrc to add
a startup entry to $HOME/.bashrc. Now if $HOME/.bashrc does not contain a
startup entry for BashStyle-NG the user is presented a tab page upon UI start
asking whether to add the entry. Also works when the startup entry for
BashStyle-NG is commented out, or if the entry is from a previous installation
of BashStyle-NG that had a different installation prefix.
@end itemize

@item Prompt Part Changes
@itemize @minus

@item PS2 / PS3 / PS4 changes: Before there's been an option for PS234. Setting
this to ">" resulted in

@itemize +
@item PS2=">"
@item PS3=">>"
@item PS4=">>>"
@end itemize

Now there's an separate option for each (including a color option each)

@item additionally PS2 / PS3 / PS4 export does now honor enable_colors setting
@end itemize

@item History Syncro Changes
@itemize @minus

@item BashStyle-NG 9.1 introduced a custom history sync functionality (for
syncing history over simultaneously running sessions), which turned out to break
Bash $HISTCONTROL, as it modified the history from outside. This is now worked
around by custom functions replacing the $HISTCONROL of Bash since it fails
due to the custom history handling functions. Please note that this might slow
down Bash a bit if you have a huge history.

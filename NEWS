               octal), example: 'check n 4.4'.

             x 'i': check if arg is a valid integer, example: 'check i
               4'.

             x 'f': check if arg is a valid float, example: 'check f
               4,4' or 'check f 4.4'.

             x 'h': check if arg is a valid hex, example: 'check h
               301DE8'.

             x 'o': check if arg is a valid octal, example 'check o 24'.

             x 'hc': check if arg is a valid hex color, example 'check

             x 's': check if arg is a valid string, example 'check s
               "How do you do?"'.

             x 'p': check if arg is a special character, example 'check
               p ?'.

             x 'c': check if arg1 contains arg2, example 'check c
               "Thanks, I'm fine." "I'm"' or 'check c 1423532 235'.

             x 'sw': check if arg1 starts with arg2, example 'check sw
               Hello H' or 'check sw 12412 124'.

             x 'ew': check if arg1 ends with arg2, example 'check ew
               Goodbye e' or 'check ew 1422412 2412'.

             x 'b': check if arg is a valid boolean, example 'check b
               $myvar'.  'check' recognizes the following as boolean
               value:

        - New switch '-z' for 'randomfile' append filename to command
          without separating space, for example 'randomfile geeqie -r
          File: -- $HOME/Pictures/*'.

        - New features for 'gitkit' applet:

             x feature 'push': first push to upstream, then push tags
               and at last push to all mirrors found in '.git_mirror'
               file.

             x feature 'taga': add tag and push to remote, example:

               'gitkit tagd TAG'.

             x feature 'tagr': rename a tag (technically removes tag and
               readds it with new name) locally and remote, example:
               'gitkit tagr OLDNAME NEWNAME', preserves first line of
               tag annotation and commit pointed to.

             x feature 'tagc': make a tag point to a different commit
               (technically removes tag and readss it pointing to new
               commit) locally and remote, example: 'gitkit tagc TAG
               COMMITID', preserves first line of tag annotation.

             x remember ssh password feature: you can now let 'gitkit'
               start an 'ssh-agent' in combination with 'ssh-add' so
               that the afore mentioned new features (and ordinary 'git'
               remote commands) don't require you to type in your
               password everytime.  You can customize whether to use
               that feature, how long 'ssh-agent' should remember the
               passwords and what keyfile to use (fallback
               '$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa').  The timer is separate in each Bash
               session.  See options 'Remember SSH Key', 'Time to
               remember' and 'SSH RSA Keyfile' in the 'Git' section of
               BashStyle-NG.

        - improved 'empty': you can now specify whether to look for
          empty files (example: 'empty f [PATH]'), or directories
          (example: 'empty d [PATH]') only.  Like before if no arg is
          passed (or arg is a path) it will search for both empty files
          and directories in given path or in 'PWD'.

        - improved 'nseq' function: allow passing the lowest number,
          aswell as the field separator (example: 'nseq 0 5 _').

        - improved 'ngroups' function: if run as root, allow passing a
          different user than current (example: 'ngroups USER').

        - improved 'bashstyle' launcher: new switches '--ini-get' and
          '--ini-set' allow getting or setting configuration values from
          command line.

   * Removed Features
        - removed 'topdir' function.

        - removed 'assign' function.

   * Misc.  Changes

        - Configure 4.4.4: several minor internal changes, fixup a Bash
          warning message.

        - move all functions from 'DATADIR/bashstyle-ng/rc/functions' to
          'DATADIR/bashstyle-ng/functions'.

        - updated german translation.

        - several minor internal changes and improvements.

10.5 "Kerala"

          'history sync' is active.

        - #252 (make): fix creating pot files.

   * New Features
        - New command 'history -D COMMAND' which deletes all entries of
          a given command from the history, example:

          'history -D rm'

          will delete all occurences of 'rm' from the history.  'history
          -D' does exact matches, so for example 'rmdir' is not removed
          from history, if 'rm' is passed as 'COMMAND'.

        - History Isolation.  This will

             x prevent storing the history to file when Bash exits

             x disable history syncronization

             x disable in-session history

             x disable the builtin history command

        - New shopt 'localvar_inherit', requires Bash version 5.0.

          requires Readline version 8.0.

   * Misc.  Changes
        - Minor user interface improvements.

             x Widget adjustments and sizes improved.

             x User can now choose between standard 'cd' or BashStyle-NG
               'lscd' or 'treecd'.

             x User can now choose between standard 'history' or
               BashStyle-NG 'History Sync' or 'History Isolation'.

        - 'bashstyle -v' and About Page now show the release codename,
          too.

        - New internally used variable 'BSNG_SESSION_TIME' contains the
          BashStyle-NG startup time in '+%I-%M-%S-%N' format.

        - Updated german translation.

10.4 "Alrest"
=============

   * Bug Fixes
        - #249 (lscolors): fix applying ls color for jpg files

   * Misc.  Changes
        - LS Colors: apply colors for alternative suffixes, too:
             x apply color for 'jpg' to 'jpeg'
             x apply color for 'tar.gz' to 'tgz'
             x apply color for 'tar.bz2' to 'tbz'

        - Make 1.1.0: simplify code, minor fixes

        - Configure 4.4.1: add '-h' in addition to '--help', minor
          changes

        - 'batchrename': proper verbose output

10.3 "Odyssey"
==============

   * Bug Fixes
        - #247 (randomfile): fix executing 'randomfile' if neither '-r'
          or '-p' are used.

        - #248 (randomfile): fix handling file or directory names with
          spaces.

   * Misc.  Changes
        - Configure 4.4.0: simplify code

        - Update 'README', 'TODO', Debian GNU/Linux package description.

        - Update german translation.

10.2 "Circus of Insanity"
=========================

   * Bug Fixes

        - #242 (systemkit): 'systemkit' did not accept the given
          'directory' for function for counting files, directories or
          overall items, instead it always used 'PWD'.  Now it respects
          a given 'directory' and uses 'PWD' if none was given.

        - #243 (systemkit): 'systemkit' result of function for countine
          files, directories or overall items were off by 1 in some
          cases.

        - #244 (randomfile): fix that 'randomfile' could not handle
          parameters passed to the application, e.g.: 'randomfile geeqie
          -r -- /home/test/Pictures/*' does now work as intended.

        - #245 (randomfile): check whether 'HOME/.randomhistory' exists
          before doing anything when '-f', '-l', '-L' or '-i' are given.

        - #246 (dd): fix that custom 'dd' options don't work.

   * New Features

        - Add possiblity to count hidden items to 'systemkit':
             x counthiddenfiles / chf
             x counthiddendirs / chd
             x counthiddenitems / chi

        - Add possibility to only print the result for 'randomfile',
          using '-p', '--print' parameter.

        - Add possibility to not specify any files, in that case it will
          use all files from 'PWD', use like 'randomfile geeqie --'.

   * Removed Features
        - '2048' game
        - 'bashtips' function
        - 'batch' function
        - 'hilow' game
        - 'quickscript' function
        - 'remount' function
        - 'wininfo' function
        - 'xmltagdelete' function
        - vim color schemes

   * Misc.  Changes
        - Add short switches for over-long switches to 'systemkit':
             x countvisiblefiles -> cvf
             x countvisibledirs -> cvd
             x countvisibleitems -> cvi
             x countoverallfiles -> cof
             x countoveralldirs -> cod
             x countoverallitems -> coi

        - Add short switches to 'apkdump':
             x name -> n
             x version -> v
             x versioncode -> c
             x perms -> p

        - Make 'sufffix' quiet by default, add '-v', '--verbose' switch,
          to get verbose output, if desired.

        - Add '-v', '--verbose' switch to 'batchrename', to get verbose
          output, if desired.

10.1 "Victory Forever"
======================

   * Bug Fixes
        - #238 (systemkit): make 'countvisibleitems' work, when 'PWD' is
          a symlinked directory.

        - #239 (functions): scripts that check for required applications
          no longer print the path to the found binary.

        - #240 (gitkit): make 'openhub' parameter support more than just
          github.com origins (for example gitlab projects are now
          properly opened in browser, aswell), also rename 'openhub'
          parameter into 'openweb'.

        - #241 (ui): fixed that the UI definition had a property
          introduced in GTK+ 3.10, so potentially not working on
          previous GTK+ versions.

   * New Features
        - 'topdir' function, returns the deepest existing toplevel
          directory for a given path, returns '1' if none found at all.

        - 'camelcase' function, transforms a string ('test_string-a b')
          in either camelcase ('TestStringAB') or word-by-word uppercase
          ('Test String A B').

   * Misc.  Changes
        - 'Equinox' and 'Power User' prompt styles now also use the
          'showuser' function instead of bash built-in '$' prompt
          variable.

        - 'lscd' and 'treecd' changes:
             x in the user interface you could previously enable both
               'lscd' and 'treecd', which is of course not supported, so
               if both were enabled, 'lscd' was used, always.  This is
               fixed now, as the user interface now only lets enable one
               or the other, not both.

             x make 'lscd' and 'treecd' strings localizable.

             x nicer banner shown after cd-ing.

             x truncate output if more than 35 items would be displayed,
               also show how many items have been ommited.

             x when user choses that custom cd creates non-existent
               directories, they now check whether user has write
               permission for top-level directory.

             x display a message if cd-ing failed because directory does
               not exist.

        - Update documentation
             x Style: add 'Equinox' and '4.4+' Sections

             x Advanced: add all new features introduced in '10.0'

        - When 'systemkit bios' is called as non-root user a message is
          printed accordingly (instead of just exiting without further
          notice).

        - Update german translation.

     <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

9.3 "Trick or Treat"
====================

   * Notes
        - This release renamed the 'nx-rc' to 'bashstyle-rc', that
          means, you'll have to re-enable 'BashStyle-NG' in your
          '$HOME/.bashrc'.  Upon first start 'BashStyle-NG' will offer
          you to do so, on it's own.

          Additional notes for Git repo users:
             x This also applies to users that have used version 9.3
               prior to commit 4e621c.

             x Any references to 'nx-rc' will be auto-removed when
               re-enabling from UI, as of commit 2ff6c0, if you
               transisted before that commit, be sure to remove 'nx-rc'
               references from your '$HOME/.bashrc' manually.

   * Bug Fixes
        - #204 (debian vendor config): fixed error in Debian vendor
          configuration, preventing BashStyle-NG UI from startup.

        - #205 (ui): fixed buttons for saving, restoring, deleting and
          reverting user configuration in UI not working.

        - #206 (manpage colors): enforce environment variable 'PAGER' to
          be 'less', else colorizing manpages might fail, if an other
          pager is used.

        - #207 (trap): fix recording exit code of last command if it's
          not 0.

        - #208 (startup): fix enabling 'BashStyle-NG' in '$HOME/.bashrc'
          from user interface in certain cases.

        - #209 (startup): add file check when enabling 'BashStyle-NG' in
          '$HOME/.bashrc', so that 'Bash' does not run into errors on
          startup when 'BashStyle-NG' was uninstalled, but the startup
          entry still exists.

          Aswell as when it was installed to a different prefix, without
          having adjusted the startup entry in '$HOME/.bashrc'.

        - #210 (configuration): when 'ini_version' of '$HOME/.bs-ng.ini'
          is bigger than 'app_ini_version', the configuration is reset
          to either vendor or factory default configuration.  When doing
          so the configuration was not reloaded by the user interface
          (which could potentially lead to a crash).

        - #211 (colorshell): new option 'Dark Terminal Background'
          allows user to set whether the terminal background is dark or
          bright.  This option is used for colorshell to prevent the
          font color being black on dark terminals, respectively white
          on bright terminals in order to avoid barely readable text
          output.

          This option also applies to all other terminal dependant color
          settings in 'BashStyle-NG', where 'white' will be 'black' on
          bright terminals, respectively 'black' will be 'white' on dark
          terminals.

        - #212 (readline): fixed setting 'bell-style' readline variable.

        - #213 (readline): fixed setting 'completion-ignore-case'
          readline variable.

        - #214 (ls colors): fixed readline not inheriting 'LS_COLORS'
          set by 'BashStyle-NG'.  This resulted in readline functions
          using distribution default 'LS_COLORS', but bash functions
          using the user set variable.

        - #215 (lastcommand): fixed last command recording to generate
          ugly results for bash prompts ('lastcommandprintable') by
          removing all newlines from the string.

        - #216 (treecd): fixed user set 'treecd' options not being
          honoured.

        - #217 (lscd, treecd, grep): force switch to monochrome output
          when user has disabled colorful prompts.

        - #218 (equinox, truncpwd): fixed prompt length calculation for
          'equinox' prompt, if 'pwdcut' ini value is not set.  Fixed
          output string length calculation for 'truncpwd' function
          aswell.

        - #219 (debug log): the debug log now properly stores all
          messages, run commands and their (error) output in
          '$HOME/.bashstyle.log' after startup.  Before this fix only
          the messages from 'BashStyle-NG' itself were stored, making
          the debug log rather useless.

        - #220 (ini_set): fixed setting ini values from shell.

        - #221 (equinox): when on linux console let display '+', '-' and
          '/' for 'lastcommand' exit code visualization instead of '✔',
          '✘' and '⊘', as they won't display correctly.

        - #222 (custom prompt builder): fixed a few bugs in the
          pre-definied prompt definitions for the custom prompt builder.

        - #223 (keybindings): fixed that keybindings were always
          changed, even if user disabled that feature from UI.

        - #224 (factory ini, debian vendor ini): enable 'extglob' shopt
          by default.  Some bash completion definitions don't work
          without (eg: vim's).

        - #225 (dd): fixed no longer working 'dd' when loading
          'bashstyle-rc' more than one time during a single bash
          session.

   * New Features
        - Previously updating the user configuration to a new version
          was only possible by invoking the 'BashStyle-NG' user
          interface.  Now the user configuration is auto-updated from
          'bashstyle-rc' upon shell start up aswell (if needed, vendor
          configuration is considered if up-to-date, else factory
          configuration will be used (same behaviour as from user
          interface)).

          Manual update is possible via 'bashstyle --update', or
          'bashstyle -u'.  If your configuration is up-to-date, nothing
          will be changed.

        - New Termcap/Manpage coloring function.  'BashStyle-NG' now
          allows you to choose the different colors for manpages from
          the User Interface, rather than only giving you a handful of
          pre-defined color schemes.

        - Added option to include the current directory to the 'PATH'
          variable.

        - Added coloring options for 'lscd' and 'treecd' for different
          'banner', 'mkdir' and 'empty' labels.

        - Added options for letting user choose what to use for
          'lastcommand' exit code visualization.  'return_good', which
          is '✔'/'+' by default 'return-bad', which is '✘'/'-' by
          default and 'return_other', which is '⊘'/'/' by default.  This
          is currently only used in 'equinox' prompt.

        - Ability to choose what to display in 'equinox' prompt.  You
          can now enable or disable the following informations:
             x system load
             x cpu load
             x ram usage (pro tip: enabling this will dramatically
               increase the time required to draw the prompt)
             x last command (and exit code)
             x process count
             x uptime

        - Added 'showuser' function.  Prompt function to either show '$'
          for normal users, a custom-set symbol.  Always displays '#'
          for root.  If colors are enabled color for normal-users will
          be 'color_user' and red for root.

        - Added 'user_char' option.  Set this to let 'showuser' display
          something else than '$' for ordinary users.

        - New Bash 4.4 features support:
             + 'EXECIGNORE' a colon-separated list of commands to ignore
               from completion.  Only matched if the *complete* filename
               matches.  For example if you want to exclude

               '/usr/bin/autoreconf'

               from command completion, you need to add something like

               '/usr/bin/autreconf' or '*/autoreconf'

               to 'EXECIGNORE'.

             + 'PS0' prompt and color setting.  A new prompt which is
               displayed after completion was done and before the
               completed command is executed.

        - New Readline 7.0 features support:
             + added Readline 7.0 master switch (enable to make use of
               the following).

             + 'Colored Completion Prefix' makes the matching prefix of
               the issued completion appear in a special color for all
               matches.

             + 'Enable Bracketed Paste' makes Bash handle multi-line
               pasted code like single-line, preventing erroneous
               completion or execution.

             + 'Vi Command Mode String' is an indicator printed before
               the last line of 'PS1' when Bash is in vi command mode.

             + 'Vi Insert Mode String' is an indicator printed before
               the last line of 'PS1' when Bash is in vi insert mode.

             + 'Emacs Mode String' is an indicator printed before the
               last line of 'PS1' when Bash is in emacs mode.

   * Updated / Improved Features
        - 'history syncronization' improved history syncronization
          erasedups, ignoredups, ignorespace and ignoreboth
          implementation.  Made it more robust in case multiple Bash
          sessions start up simultaneously (should throw a lot less to
          no more errors).

        - 'random' function's '--numericalrange', '-r' param previously
          only allowed setting the 'highest' value of random range,
          starting from zero.  Now it's possible to set the 'lowest'
          value optionally, aswell.  Both syntaxes are supported:

          'random -r 10' will give you a random number between 0 and 10
          'random -r 5 10' will give you a random number between 5 and
          10

        - 'colors' added support for both 'grey' and 'white' in all
          color settings.  Note: depending on your terminal's color
          settings you might not see a difference here, that's not a
          bug.

        - 'colorshell' does no longer pollute 'PS1...4' variables.  It
          does now store 'PS1...4' once per session to 'OLDPS1...4' and
          appends it's randomly choosen text color to the it.

        - 'equinox' prompt now shows '⊘' in yellow when exiting 'git
          log' using 'q' key, instead of '✘' in red.  Exiting 'git log'
          results in return code 141, but it's not an actual error, thus
          the new state was added.

   * UI changes
        - Use 'GtkSwitch'es instead of 'GtkRadionButton's for main
          switches in the UI.

        - Make the radio buttons 'use lscd instead of cd' and 'use
          treecd instead of cd' exclude each other.

   * Configure

        - 4.3.8
             + code review.
             + make build dependencies a separate dependency group.

   * Misc.  Changes

        - Translation Domain changes:
             x old: 'bs-ng', new: 'bashstyle'

             x old: 'nx-rc', new: 'bashstyle-rc'

        - Improvements to 'bashstyle' launcher script.

        - Minor improvements to the Custom Prompt Builder UI.

        - Added option to launch Terminal Emulator from UI (uses
          'x-terminal-emulator').

        - Since a few versions the code for setting colors has been
          changed, so we no longer need a monochrome version of each
          prompt style, avoiding lots of (mostly) duplicated code.

        - Standardize shebangs in python scripts (and remove
          corresponding lintian override).

        - Updated german translation.

        - Don't mark setting's name and a few others as translatable
          strings.

        - Changed string 'GIT' to 'Git' in the UI and other pacles.

        - Move last command recording to the end of 'BashStyle-NG'
          initialization, no need to record 'BashStyle-NG's startup.

        - 'WidgetHandler' now supports 'GtkSwitch'es, 'GtkButton's and
          'GtkLabel's, Custom Prompt Builders special 'GtkButton's and
          'GtkComboBox'es.

        - Less environment pollution by 'unset'ing a lot of variables
          which are of no use after 'BashStyle-NG' initialization.

        - Simplified color setup mechanism for non/echoable prompt part
          colors.

        - Minor fix for 'dbg_msg' function, now some of the output
          strings in '$HOME/.bashstyle.log' are more readable.

        - Minor coding style changes / improvements.

     <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

9.2 "Galvanize"
===============

   * Bug Fixes
        - #191 (make): gtk-update-icon-cache was not properly invoked
          after make install

        - #192 (custom prompt builder): inserting prompt parts from
          GtkComboBoxes did not work

        - #193 (nano): setting Nano UI Colors an Tabs to Spaces did not
          work

        - #194 (colors): color definitions have not been properly
          exported to external scripts, which thus always displayed
          monochrome output

        - #195 (nx-rc): fixed filtering out 'trap' from 'lastcommand'
          storing [Mingye Wang]

        - #196 (nx-rc): fixup 'lastexit' value storing [Mingye Wang]

        - #197 (nano) (vim) (readline) (keybindings): fixup file
          existence checks which are intended to prevent file conflicts
          when multiple Bash sessions are started at the same time
          [Mingye Wang]

        - #198 (nx-rc): fixup detection of vendor ini version on first
          load of nx-rc if no user ini exists

        - #199 (reload): fixup reload to properly restore the complete
          environment, including BashStyle-NG and Bash Programmable
          Completion.

        - #200 (dd_opts): ensure setting DD_OPTS is properly done.

        - #201 (ls_colors): setting Tar/XZ color from UI didn't work.

        - #202 (configure): fixed last arguement passed to configure not
          being honoured.

   * Configuration File Changes
        - Additionally to factory and vendor (/etc/bs-ng_vendor.ini)
          configuration BashStyle-NG now also checks for user backup
          ($HOME/.bs-ng.ini.save) configuration when resetting
          configuration

        - Before using user backup or vendor configuration in any way do
          a dry-load to ensure the files are in proper shape, if they
          contain errors skip them

        - When the configuration file can't be loaded due errors, let
          BashStyle-NG auto-reset the configuration using user backup
          (if it exists) > vendor configuration (if it exists) > factory
          configuration (in that order).  This prevents BashStyle-NG
          from crashing if there's something wrong with the user
          configuration file

        - Added new Category "Configuration" which allows to:

             + Backup
             + Restore (from user backup configuration)
             + delete Backup configuration
             + Reset (reset from vendor or factory configuration) the
               configuration
             + Edit various configuration files (uses xdg-open to open
               files), namely:

                  x .bashrc
                  x .bashstyle.custom (bashrc-extension always loaded
                    after BashStyle-NG, thus can use BashStyle-NG
                    variables and functions reliably)
                  x .vimrc.custom (vimrc extension that is not managed
                    by BashStyle-NG)
                  x .inputrc.custom (inputrc extension that is not
                    managed by BashStyle-NG)

          also shows version of user, user backup, vendor and factory
          configuration files (None for vendor and user backup if they
          don't exist)

        - icon name for this category in UI: bs-ng-config

        - after configuration is restored or reset the application is
          restarted

   * StartUp Mechanism Changes
        - Before BashStyle-NG embedded into /etc/bash.bashrc or
          /etc/bashrc to add a startup entry to $HOME/.bashrc.  Now if
          $HOME/.bashrc does not contain a startup entry for
          BashStyle-NG the user is presented a tab page upon UI start
          asking whether to add the entry.  Also works when the startup
          entry for BashStyle-NG is commented out, or if the entry is
          from a previous installation of BashStyle-NG that had a
          different installation prefix.

   * Prompt Part Changes

        - PS2 / PS3 / PS4 changes: Before there's been an option for
          PS234.  Setting this to ">" resulted in

             + PS2=">"
             + PS3=">>"
             + PS4=">>>"

          Now there's an separate option for each (including a color
          option each)

        - additionally PS2 / PS3 / PS4 export does now honor
          enable_colors setting

   * History Syncro Changes

        - BashStyle-NG 9.1 introduced a custom history sync
          functionality (for syncing history over simultaneously running
          sessions), which turned out to break Bash $HISTCONTROL, as it
          modified the history from outside.  This is now worked around
          by custom functions replacing the $HISTCONROL of Bash since it
          fails due to the custom history handling functions.  Please
          note that this might slow down Bash a bit if you have a huge
          history.

   * New Functions

        - xmltagdelete: delete tags from xml files, see 'xmltagdelete
          --help'

        - 2048.bash: 2048 game in Bash, see '2048.bash --help'

   * New Settings

        - Added option to display progressbar for 'dd', requires version
          8.24 or newer.

   * Documentation

        - Add texinfo documentation describing all features of
          BashStyle-NG (work in progress).

9.2.0 "Galvanize"
=================

   * Bug Fixes
        - #191 (make): gtk-update-icon-cache was not properly invoked
          after make install

        - #192 (custom prompt builder): inserting prompt parts from
          GtkComboBoxes did not work

        - #193 (nano): setting Nano UI Colors an Tabs to Spaces did not
          work

        - #194 (colors): color definitions have not been properly
          exported to external scripts, which thus always displayed
          monochrome output

        - #195 (nx-rc): fixed filtering out 'trap' from 'lastcommand'
          storing [Mingye Wang]

        - #196 (nx-rc): fixup 'lastexit' value storing [Mingye Wang]

        - #197 (nano) (vim) (readline) (keybindings): fixup file
          existence checks which are intented to prevent file conflicts
          when multiple Bash sessions are started at the same time
          [Mingye Wang]

        - #198 (nx-rc): fixup detection of vendor ini version on first
          load of nx-rc if no user ini exists

   * Configuration File Changes
        - Additionally to factory and vendor (/etc/bs-ng_vendor.ini)
          configuration BashStyle-NG now also checks for user backup
          ($HOME/.bs-ng.ini.save) configuration when resetting
          configuration

        - Before using user backup or vendor configuration in any way do
          a dry-load to ensure the files are in proper shape, if they
          contain errors skip them

        - When the configuration file can't be loaded due errors, let
          BashStyle-NG auto-reset the configuration using user backup
          (if it exists) > vendor configuration (if it exists) > factory
          configuration (in that order).  This prevents BashStyle-NG
          from crashing if there's something wrong with the user
          configuration file

        - Added new Category "Configuration" which allows to:

             + Backup
             + Restore (from user backup configuration)
             + delete Backup configuration
             + Reset (reset from vendor or factory configuration) the
               configuration
             + Edit various configuration files (uses xdg-open to open
               files), namely:

                  x .bashrc
                  x .bashstyle.custom (bashrc-extension always loaded
                    after BashStyle-NG, thus can use BashStyle-NG
                    variables and functions reliably)
                  x .vimrc.custom (vimrc extension that is not managed
                    by BashStyle-NG)
                  x .inputrc.custom (inputrc extension that is not
                    managed by BashStyle-NG)

          also shows version of user, user backup, vendor and factory
          configuration files (None for vendor and user backup if they
          don't exist)

        - icon name for this category in UI: bs-ng-config

        - after configuration is restored or reset the application is
          restarted

   * StartUp Mechanism Changes
        - Before BashStyle-NG embedded into /etc/bash.bashrc or
          /etc/bashrc to add a startup entry to $HOME/.bashrc.  Now if
          $HOME/.bashrc does not contain a startup entry for
          BashStyle-NG the user is presented a tab page upon UI start
          asking whether to add the entry.  Also works when the startup
          entry for BashStyle-NG is commented out, or if the entry is
          from a previous installation of BashStyle-NG that had a
          different installation prefix.

   * Prompt Part Changes

        - PS2 / PS3 / PS4 changes: Before there's been an option for
          PS234.  Setting this to ">" resulted in

             + PS2=">"
             + PS3=">>"
             + PS4=">>>"

          Now there's an separate option for each (including a color
          option each)

        - additionally PS2 / PS3 / PS4 export does now honor
          enable_colors setting

   * History Syncro Changes

        - BashStyle-NG 9.1 introduced a custom history sync
          functionality (for syncing history over simultaneously running
          sessions), which turned out to break Bash $HISTCONTROL, as it
          modified the history from outside.  This is now worked around
          by custom functions replacing the $HISTCONROL of Bash since it
          fails due to the custom history handling functions.  Please
          note that this might slow down Bash a bit if you have a huge
          history.

   * New Functions

        - xmltagdelete: delete tags from xml files, see 'xmltagdelete
          --help'

   * Misc.  Changes

        - undobuffer: enforce Gtk version 3 to be loaded (makes a
          startup warning shut up

   * Configure

        - 4.3.6
             + add '--docdir' switch back
             + add '--mandir' switch

             + remove system bashrc detection
             + remove -profiledir switch
             + remove -bashrc switch
             + minor string changes

        - 4.3.4
             + remove -quiet switch
             + globally define PYMAXVER and PYMINVER (python minimum and
               maximum versions)
             + globally define PYAMXVER_P and PYMINVER_P (printable
               python minimum and maximum python versions for configure
               messages)
             + remove unused variable

9.3 "Trick or Treat"
====================

   * Bug Fixes
        - #204 (debian vendor config): fixed error in Debian vendor
          configuration, preventing BashStyle-NG UI from startup.

        - #205 (ui): fixed buttons for saving, restoring, deleting and
          reverting user configuration in UI not working.

        - #206 (manpage colors): enforce environment variable 'PAGER' to
          be 'less', else colorizing manpages might fail, if an other
          pager is used.

        - #207 (trap): fix recording exit code of last command if it
          fails.

        - #208 (startup): fix enabling 'BashStyle-NG' in '$HOME/.bashrc'
          from user interface in certain cases.

        - #209 (startup): add file check when enabling 'BashStyle-NG' in
          '$HOME/.bashrc', so that 'Bash' does not run into errors on
          startup when 'BashStyle-NG' was uninstalled, but the startup
          entry still exists.  Aswell as when it was installed to a
          different prefix, without having adjusted the startup entry in
          '$HOME/.bashrc' (or re-enabled 'BashStyle-NG' from the user
          interface (which would update the startup entry).

        - #210 (configuration): when 'ini_version' of '$HOME/.bs-ng.ini'
          is bigger than 'app_ini_version', the configuration is reset
          to either vendor or factory default configuration.  When doing
          so the configuration was not reloaded by the user interface
          (which could potentially lead to a crash).

        - #211 (colorshell): new option 'Dark Terminal Background'
          allows user to set whether the terminal background is dark or
          bright.  This option is used for colorshell to prevent the
          font color being black on dark terminals, respectively
          white/grey on bright terminals in order to avoid barely
          readable text output.

          Note: this option will be used for other features in future
          aswell.

   * New Features
        - New Termcap/Manpage coloring function.  'BashStyle-NG' now
          allows you to choose the different colors for manpages from
          the User Interface, rather than only giving you a handful of
          pre-defined color schemes.

   * Updated / Improved Features
        - 'random' function's '--numericalrange', '-r' param previously
          only allowed setting the 'highest' value of random range,
          starting from zero.  Now it's possible to set the 'lowest'
          value optionally, aswell.  Both syntaxes are supported:

          'random -r 10' will give you a random number between 0 and 10
          'random -r 5 10' will give you a random number between 5 and
          10

   * UI changes
        - Use 'GtkSwitch'es instead of 'GtkRadionButton's for main
          switches in the UI.

        - Make the radio buttons 'use lscd instead of cd' and 'use
          treecd instead of cd' exclude each other.

   * Configure

        - 4.3.8
             + code review
             + make build dependencies a separate dependency group.

   * Misc.  Changes
        - Improvements to 'bashstyle' launcher script.

        - Standardize shebangs in python scripts (and remove
          corresponding lintian override).

        - Updated german translation.

        - Change string 'GIT' to 'Git' in the UI and other pacles.

        - 'WidgetHandler' now supports 'GtkSwitch'es.

9.2 "Galvanize"
===============

   * Bug Fixes
        - #191 (make): gtk-update-icon-cache was not properly invoked
          after make install

        - #192 (custom prompt builder): inserting prompt parts from
          GtkComboBoxes did not work

        - #193 (nano): setting Nano UI Colors an Tabs to Spaces did not
          work

        - #194 (colors): color definitions have not been properly
          exported to external scripts, which thus always displayed
          monochrome output

        - #195 (nx-rc): fixed filtering out 'trap' from 'lastcommand'
          storing [Mingye Wang]

        - #196 (nx-rc): fixup 'lastexit' value storing [Mingye Wang]

        - #197 (nano) (vim) (readline) (keybindings): fixup file
          existence checks which are intended to prevent file conflicts
          when multiple Bash sessions are started at the same time
          [Mingye Wang]

        - #198 (nx-rc): fixup detection of vendor ini version on first
          load of nx-rc if no user ini exists

        - #199 (reload): fixup reload to properly restore the complete
          environment, including BashStyle-NG and Bash Programmable
          Completion.

        - #200 (dd_opts): ensure setting DD_OPTS is properly done.

        - #201 (ls_colors): setting Tar/XZ color from UI didn't work.

        - #202 (configure): fixed last arguement passed to configure not
          being honoured.

   * Configuration File Changes
        - Additionally to factory and vendor (/etc/bs-ng_vendor.ini)
          configuration BashStyle-NG now also checks for user backup
          ($HOME/.bs-ng.ini.save) configuration when resetting
          configuration

        - Before using user backup or vendor configuration in any way do
          a dry-load to ensure the files are in proper shape, if they
          contain errors skip them

        - When the configuration file can't be loaded due errors, let
          BashStyle-NG auto-reset the configuration using user backup
          (if it exists) > vendor configuration (if it exists) > factory
          configuration (in that order).  This prevents BashStyle-NG
          from crashing if there's something wrong with the user
          configuration file

        - Added new Category "Configuration" which allows to:

             + Backup
             + Restore (from user backup configuration)
             + delete Backup configuration
             + Reset (reset from vendor or factory configuration) the
               configuration
             + Edit various configuration files (uses xdg-open to open
               files), namely:

                  x .bashrc
                  x .bashstyle.custom (bashrc-extension always loaded
                    after BashStyle-NG, thus can use BashStyle-NG
                    variables and functions reliably)
                  x .vimrc.custom (vimrc extension that is not managed
                    by BashStyle-NG)
                  x .inputrc.custom (inputrc extension that is not
                    managed by BashStyle-NG)

          also shows version of user, user backup, vendor and factory
          configuration files (None for vendor and user backup if they
          don't exist)

        - icon name for this category in UI: bs-ng-config

        - after configuration is restored or reset the application is
          restarted

   * StartUp Mechanism Changes
        - Before BashStyle-NG embedded into /etc/bash.bashrc or
          /etc/bashrc to add a startup entry to $HOME/.bashrc.  Now if
          $HOME/.bashrc does not contain a startup entry for
          BashStyle-NG the user is presented a tab page upon UI start
          asking whether to add the entry.  Also works when the startup
          entry for BashStyle-NG is commented out, or if the entry is
          from a previous installation of BashStyle-NG that had a
          different installation prefix.

   * Prompt Part Changes

        - PS2 / PS3 / PS4 changes: Before there's been an option for
          PS234.  Setting this to ">" resulted in

             + PS2=">"
             + PS3=">>"
             + PS4=">>>"

          Now there's an separate option for each (including a color
          option each)

        - additionally PS2 / PS3 / PS4 export does now honor
          enable_colors setting

   * History Syncro Changes

        - BashStyle-NG 9.1 introduced a custom history sync
          functionality (for syncing history over simultaneously running
          sessions), which turned out to break Bash $HISTCONTROL, as it
          modified the history from outside.  This is now worked around
          by custom functions replacing the $HISTCONROL of Bash since it
          fails due to the custom history handling functions.  Please
          note that this might slow down Bash a bit if you have a huge
          history.

   * New Functions

        - xmltagdelete: delete tags from xml files, see 'xmltagdelete
          --help'

        - 2048.bash: 2048 game in Bash, see '2048.bash --help'

   * New Settings

        - Added option to display progressbar for 'dd', requires version
          8.24 or newer.

   * Documentation

        - Add texinfo documentation describing all features of
          BashStyle-NG (work in progress).
        - currently documented:
             + Introduction
             + News (ChangeLog)
             + Configuration file handling
             + Advanced options (UI section)
             + Style options (UI section)

             + UI icon names
        - Add manpage for 'bashstyle' executable.
        - Add 'Documentation' icon ('bs-ng-doc') icon in UI, opening the
          documenation using 'xdg-open'.
